# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective-Agile-Project

Essential Questions Reflection
**How do I figure out what users want and turn that into a program? How do user stories help?

Honestly, the first step for me is just listening to what people actually want—not just what they say at first, but what they really need. Sometimes it’s easy to get lost in the details, so I like using user stories because they help break things down. When I write stuff like, “As a user, I want to book a trip, so that I can go on vacation,” it makes it way clearer what I’m supposed to build. User stories keep me focused so I don’t end up coding a bunch of random features nobody asked for.

**How do I start working on a program? What Agile stuff do I want to use in the future?

I’m not gonna lie—big projects can be overwhelming. So now, I try to chop everything up into small chunks and just work on a little bit at a time. Agile helped me with that for sure. I like the idea of just building a piece, checking it, getting feedback, and then moving on. For my future work, I definitely want to keep breaking things down into sprints and actually talking things out with people instead of suffering in silence when something goes wrong.

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

To me, it’s not just about doing your part. You gotta show up, actually talk to your group, and help out if someone’s stuck. It’s about being cool with sharing ideas and not being afraid to say when you don’t get something (which, it happens). When everyone’s on the same page and helps one other out, the project just goes better. Plus, it makes the whole thing less stressful and, honestly, a little more fun.
